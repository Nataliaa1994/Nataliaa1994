 Once upon a time, I fell in love with deep learning. It took me months to learn to code. Nowadays, I am have fun tinkering in Python. I love maths and coding in Python.( I know R but Python is better for deep learning applications). ðŸ‘¯ I look forward to collaborating with other content creators.
