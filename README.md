 Once upon a time, I fell in love with deep learning. It took me months to learn to code. Nowadays, I am have fun tinkering in Python. 
 I love maths and coding in Python.( I know R but Python is better for deep learning applications).
 
 
 Have a look at some of my projects on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nataliaole/fashion-dataset-classifier?scriptVersionId=46262647) as well.
 
 Check out my latest project from Kaggle [Latest_project](https://www.kaggle.com/nataliaole/notebooks).
 
 ðŸ‘¯ I look forward to collaborating with other content creators.
